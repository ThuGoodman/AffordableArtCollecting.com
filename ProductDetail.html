It pains me to sell it. A beautifully executed genre scene of European village life. Signed in the lower right. I actually prefer Tesson’s European subjects to his Far East Orientalist works.</br></br> - He is in the collections of many of the world’s top museums. The frame has some wear, as can be seen in the photographs. It also has glass glazing that I believe to be original from the period because there is a slight waviness. I’d recommend installing UV blocking plexiglass. I hang this in a very dim section of my house to avoid the natural light.</br></br> - Not examined outside of frame (largely because I didn’t want to disturb the dust backing).</br></br> - Please see the photographs as a part of the condition report. The paper and watercolor looks to be in excellent condition. You will probably want to replace the matting and glass. I have no idea if the matboard is archival.</br></br> - Frame <b>size</b> approximately: 15”x 10.5”</br></br> - Matting window size approximately: 5.5” x 9.75”</br></br> - Brief Bio:</br></br>   +Born in 1820 in Calais (Pas-de-Calais).

This is from the 1959 movie, The Tiger of Eschnapur starring Dana Paget and directed by Fritz Lang. Manno’s work was prevalent from the 30’s to the 60’s.</br></br> - I purchased this work years ago at an antique shop in Rome, Italy. The only information I got from the antique store owner was that it was gifted by Manno to his housekeeper and later ended up in the antique store.</br></br> - This is a triumphantly painted work with clear bravado brushwork. It would be a centerpiece for a collection based in illustration or figurative realism. I am genuinely sad at the thought of parting with this work.</br></br> - It comes exactly as I found it years ago in Rome— no glazing or dust backing and in the original frame. The sticker and text still attached. I’m unable to read the text.</br></br> - Please use the photographs as part of the description. Painting is bright and vibrant and in very clean condition with some general mild wear, as expected for a painting of this age. Very small dent (maybe 1 cm) on tan section of small figure (last picture). This is barely noticeable.</br></br> - Examining it closely from the back it appears someone stapled it into the frame so it will require a bit of delicate maneuvering to remove it. I included a photo of one of the staples. There seems to be a total of five. Not examined outside of frame. This piece would greatly benefit from being reframed.</br></br> - Shipped with USPS Priority Mail.</br></br> - Frame <b>size</b> approximately 15.5”x26”</br></br> - Board <b>size</b> approximately 14.5” x 25”</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264387775861?hash=item3d8ebd4d75:g:tewAAOSwKs1dHof-">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',

They opened a grocery store, but by 1911 Hugo had hung out his shingle as a photographer of landscapes and nature studies. He worked in the soft-focus Pictorialist style, using waxed-paper negatives to enhance the atmospheric effects in his prints.</br></br>   +Six years later the Hugos relocated north to Santa Cruz, where Hugo opened a studio and became known locally for his photographs of cypress and eucalyptus trees along the Monterey coast. In 1929 he returned to La Jolla and re-established his studio there.</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264770136638?hash=item3da587aa3e:g:d50AAOSwgdZe7lGf">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',

Please see the photographs as a part of the condition report.</br></br> - <b>Page size</b> approximately 8.6”x11”.</br></br> - From Wikipedia:</br></br> + Born Naomi Siegler, she was a native of Princeton, New Jersey. Her parents were Samuel Siegler and Elsie Siegler (née Radnitzky), a sister of Man Ray. She first studied photography under Berenice Abbott at the New School for Social Research in 1943, following this with studies in art, photography, and music at Bennington College from 1944 until 1947. The next year she spent in California with her uncle, studying his techniques. In 1950 she married the architect and sculptor David Savage, with whom she moved to Paris, living there for some years.</br></br> + During her career Savage received an award from the Cassandra Foundation in 1970, and a photography fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1971. In 1976 she received the silver award from the Art Directors Club.[1] Later in life, Savage returned to live in Princeton, where she died.[2]</br></br> + Savage was heavily influence by her uncle, Man Ray, prompting her to experiment with the medium of photography, combining traditional techniques with more unusual processes, including some of her own design.[1] She worked extensively with photogravure and photoengraving, transforming these mechanical printing techniques to be used for aesthetic effects rather than duplication.</br></br> + Unlike many photographers, Savage considered the metal plate that photographs are etched on to be a work of art in its own right. She pioneered the use of using the photographic metal plate to produce a three dimensional form with a metallic surface.[3]</br></br> + Savage explored variations in color and texture in her work often by using inked and intaglio relief prints. Many of her works were created by combining media such as collage, negative images, texture screening, multiple exposure, photograms, solarization, toning, printing on metallic foils. Her works focus on a variety of subject matter and imagery, which has included portraits, landscapes, human figures, mannequins, masks, toys, kitchen utensils, dental and ophthalmological equipment.[4]</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265502691910?hash=item3dd1319246:g:jE4AAOSwqE1gtkQW">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',

Shipped with USPS Priority Package.</br></br> - Minor blemishes including soft staining at bottom, otherwise bright and sharp. Please see the photographs as a part of the condition report.</br></br> - <b>Page size</b> approximately 11” x 8.25”</br></br> - Brief bio from Wikipedia:</br></br>   +Howitt was a member of an old Nottinghamshire Quaker family. In early life he lived at Chigwell, near Epping Forest, Essex, was financially independent and devoted himself to field sports. However he ran into financial difficulties and was obliged to turn to art as a profession - which up until then he had engaged in as a talented amateur.</br></br>   +Coming to London, he was for a time a drawing master at Samuel Goodenough&apos;s school in Ealing. In 1783, he exhibited 3 coloured drawings of hunting subjects with the Incorporated Society of Artists. From time to time he continued to exhibit there and at the Royal Academy, beginning in 1784 with a hunting piece, followed in 1785 by two landscapes - "A view of the ruins of an abbey" and "Fairlop Oak". In 1793 he showed "Jaques and the Deer" and "A Fox Hunt"; in 1794, "Smugglers alarmed"; in 1800, two pictures titled "Deer"; in 1814 "Dead game"; and in 1815, "Bella, horrida Bella".[2] He probably exhibited so little because he was in such demand as a commercial illustrator.[3]</br></br>   +Howitt worked both in oils and water-colours, for the most part confining himself to sporting subjects and illustrations of natural history, which were carefully executed, spirited and truthful. These, as Howitt represented in his New Work of Animals, were “drawn from the life" and published so as to "assist the pencil of the designer who has not had an opportunity to pay the same attention to this branch of the art”. However, notes in one sketchbook containing watercolours of apes and monkeys indicate that, while some there certainly were viewed in private menageries, others were studies of stuffed specimens from William Bullock&apos;s museum and the British Museum.[4]</br></br>   +Howitt was closely associated in his art with Thomas Rowlandson, whose sister he married, and his works did, at one time, often pass for those of his brother-in-law; but, unlike Rowlandson, he was a practical sportsman, and his scenes were more accurately composed. He was a clever and industrious etcher, and published a great number of plates similar in character to his drawings, and delicately executed with a fine needle. He also produced a number of caricatures in the manner of Rowlandson.</br></br>   +Howitt was particularly noted for the illustrations in (Captain) Thomas Williamson&apos;s Oriental Field Sports (1807), based on sketches made by the author in India .[5] He also illustrated several other works: Thoughts on Hunting (London: D. Bremner, 1798),[6] Other publications included Miscellaneous Etchings of Animals (50 plates, 1803); British Field Sports (20 coloured plates, 1807); The Angler&apos;s Manual (12 plates, 1808); A New Work of Animals (100 plates, 1811); Groups of Animals (24 plates, 1811); The British Sportsman (70 plates, 1812); Foreign Field Sports (110 plates, 1819).</br></br>   +In 1822 Howitt died in Somers Town, London, and was buried in St. Pancras cemetery.</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264793117882?hash=item3da6e654ba:g:f~QAAOSwowJfCk77">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',

Chapman after bumberry, Shakespeare, 1792.</br></br> - In the collection of the MET and the British Museum.</br></br> - From the Met’s website:</br> + Bunbury&#39;s "Shakespeare" consisted of twenty-prints published between 1792 and 1797, issued periodically in sets of four. The publisher Thomas Macklin was inspired by the success of Boydell&#39;s Shakespeare Gallery to open a rival Poets Gallery in 1787. He then commissioned a set of large watercolors from Bunbury of comic Shakesperean subjects with related prints issued by subscription. The artist was the younger son in an old gentry family who had amused fellow students with comic drawings at Westminster School in London, then at Cambridge University. He became a friend of Thomas Rowlandson, who etched many Bunbury designs. Most of Bunbury&#39;s income came, however, from army positions and the patronage of the Duke of York, whom he served as equerry. The Shakespeare series of watercolors rank among the artist&#39;s most ambitious and soon belonged to the Duchess of York. John Chapman, a follower of Francesco Bartolozzi, produced this stipple engraving which shows Touchstone, the fool in “As You Like It,” exiled from court with Rosalind and Celia and just arrived in the Forest of Arden.</br> + Rosalind, Celia & Touchstone (Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act 2, Scene 2), John Chapman (British, active 1792–1823), Stipple engraving and etching.</br> + Rosalind, Celia & Touchstone (Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act 2, Scene 2), John Chapman (British, active 1792–1823), Stipple engraving and etching</br></br> - Object Details: Edgewear, browning and creasing.

He belonged to the Swiss avantgarde during the 1960ies and 1970ies. From today’s perspective his works became universally valid and in its own sense they form part of a cosmic whole. A healthy relationship between humans beings, earth and all creatures has been very important for Carl Bucher, as he was terrified by injustice. His earth-bound creations witness the physical power of their formation. They also contain and leave real traces of biographical content. Carl Bucher develops his motifs out of formable materials and by doing so faces himself, the scientist and homo sapiens, the existentialist and homo politicus.</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264930516737?hash=item3daf16df01:g:B4cAAOSwBGJfqD9p">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',

Picasso said that "the lack of knowledge of Beaudin&apos;s work constitutes one of the greatest injustices of our time.” In 1962, Beaudin was awarded in the Grand Prix National des Arts and had a long series of exhibitions in France and abroad until 1970.</br></br><center><a class="button" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265086940501?hash=item3db869b555:g:LhkAAOSw4sVgTMhw">View This Item on eBay</a></center>',
